# SCT_to_OpenRadar
Converts coordinate definitions from sector to OpenRadar files.

Just paste any coordinate definitions from a sector file and click "Convert".
To avoid extraneous output, ensure that your pasted input contains coordinate definitions only, and not any additional elements such as comments. Blank lines and leading/trailing whitespaces are okay.

This will only convert coordinate definitions, so be sure you have formatted the rest of your OpenRadar file as described here: http://wiki.flightgear.org/OpenRadar:_Editing_routes
